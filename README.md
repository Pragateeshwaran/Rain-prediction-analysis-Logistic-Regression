## Introduction

This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow by analyzing historical weather data and building a machine learning model. Rain prediction is an essential task in meteorology and has numerous applications, from agriculture to disaster preparedness.

## Project Overview

The project can be broken down into the following key steps:

1. **Requirements**: Ensure you have the required libraries and tools installed.

2. **Data**: Acquire and load the weather data used for analysis and prediction.

3. **Data Visualization and Cleaning**: Visualize the data and perform data cleaning to prepare it for analysis.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: Process the data by encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and handling outliers.

5. **Model Building**: Train and evaluate a machine learning model to predict whether it will rain tomorrow.

6. **Results**: Present the results of the analysis and model performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided code)
- Required Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)

You can install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Data

The weather data is sourced from the 'weatherAUS.csv' file, which contains various attributes related to weather conditions and whether it rained the next day. The dataset includes features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

## Data Visualization and Cleaning

- Visualizations: Count plot of the target column, correlation among numeric attributes, and more.
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values, parsing dates, encoding cyclic features, and data analysis to identify and remove outliers.

## Data Preprocessing

- Label encoding categorical columns.
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler.
- Outlier detection and removal.

## Model Building

- Building a logistic regression model for rain prediction.
- Model evaluation and accuracy assessment.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 84.45% on the test data. It can predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (see the "Requirements" section).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the code cells for data analysis and model building.
